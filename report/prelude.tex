% ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
\begin{acknowledgments}
I thank my advisor, Professor Soumya Ray, for his assistance through the entire process of
developing this idea and creating this thesis.  When I began this program I knew very
little of the process of research, but Professor Ray guided me through creating my first
prototype of this system and my first paper for submission to a conference.  From there,
we ended up here, with the submission of my thesis in order to obtain the degree of
Master of Science.  I am very thankful to him for all his help, edits, and guidance.\\

I also thank Professor Wyatt Newman for suggesting that I attempt this, my thesis committee
for reviewing my work, and (some other people).
