	abstract = {Natural language generation {(NLG)} is a major subfield of computational linguistics with a long tradition as an application area of automated planning systems. While current mainstream approaches have largely ignored the planning approach to {NLG}, several recent publications have sparked a renewed interest in this area. In this article, we investigate the extent to which these new {NLG} approaches profit from the advances in planner expressiveness and efficiency. Our findings are mixed. While modern planners can readily handle the search problems that arise in our {NLG} experiments, their overall runtime is often dominated by the grounding step they perform as preprocessing. Furthermore, small changes in the structure of a domain can significantly shift the balance between search and preprocessing. Overall, our experiments show that the off-the-shelf planners we tested are unusably slow for nontrivial {NLG} problem instances. As a result, we offer our domains and experiences as challenges for the planning community.},

In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, {UCT}, that applies bandit ideas to guide Monte-Carlo planning. In finite-horizon or discounted {MDPs} the algorithm is shown to be consistent and finite sample bounds are derived on the estimation error due to sampling. Experimental results show that in several domains, {UCT} is significantly more efficient than its alternatives. 1},

Like the {HSP} system, {FF} relies on forward state space search, using a heuristic that estimates goal distances by ignoring delete lists. Unlike {HSP's} heuristic, our method does not assume facts to be independent. We introduce a novel search strategy that combines hill-climbing with systematic search, and we show how other powerful heuristic information can be extracted and used to prune the search space. {FF} was the most successful automatic planner at the recent {AIPS-2000} planning competition. We review the results of the competition, give data for other benchmark domains, and investigate the reasons for the runtime performance of {FF} compared to {HSP.}},

	abstract = {The use of a single grammar for both parsing and generation is an idea with a certain elegance, the desirability of which several researchers have noted. In this paper, we discuss a more radical possibility: not only can a single grammar be used by different processes engaged in various "directions" of processing, but one and the same language-processing architecture can be used for processing the grammar in the various modes. In particular, parsing and generation can be viewed as two processes engaged in by a single parameterized theorem prover for the logical interpretation of the formalism. We discuss our current implementation of such an architecture, which is parameterized in such a way that it can be used for either purpose with grammars written in the {PATR} formalism. Furthermore, the architecture allows fine tuning to reflect different processing strategies, including parsing models intended to mimic psycholinguistic phenomena. This tuning allows the parsing system to operate within the same realm of efficiency as previous architectures for parsing alone, but with much greater flexibility for engaging in other processing regimes.},
