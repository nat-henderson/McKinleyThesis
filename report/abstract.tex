  We study the problem of generating a single sentence which satisfies
  a communicative goal, given a grammar which specifies the language.
  We model the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP),
  using a reward function which reflects that communicative goal.  We use
  probabilistic planning to solve the MDP and generate a sentence which
  satisfies the communicative goal.  We compare our approach to a current
  state-of-the-art generation system, and find that our system can generally
  match the state-of-the-art in both performance and generation quality, while
  offering generation capabilities that exceed those usually found in planning-based
  generators.
